        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the warm water to the flour mixture, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or spatula until a soft dough forms. If the dough seems too dry, add a little more water. If it seems too wet, add a little more flour.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough for a few minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. If it's too sticky, add a little more flour. If it's too dry, add a little more water.</li>
            <li>Lightly flour a clean surface and roll out the dough to a thickness of about 1/2 inch. Cut the dough into strips about 12 inches long.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Cook the noodles in batches, turning them occasionally, until they are golden brown and crispy. Drain on paper towels.</li>
            <li>To serve, place the cooked noodles in a large bowl. Drizzle with honey, if desired. Toss to combine and serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
